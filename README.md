# Fortran
This repo is a motley collection of Fortran codes I wrote as a maths student,
mostly for a postgrad Computational Maths paper in 2014. They're collected here
unedited and as such the build framework is still tied to my dev environment
of the time ([Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org/photran/) and
[Intel compiler](https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers)). One day
I'll tidy them up and use GNU Autotools to make them more portable. One day...

## Historical Note

Anyone who's used [f2c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F2c), the Bell Labs
Fortran-to-C converter, may have seen this gem in the header file
[f2c.h](http://www.netlib.org/f2c/f2c.h):

```
/**  barf  [ba:rf]  2.  "He suggested using FORTRAN, and everybody barfed."

	- From The Shogakukan DICTIONARY OF NEW ENGLISH (Second edition) */
```

I recently bought a second-hand copy of this dictionary from
[Amazon Japan](http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4095100923), and sure
enough, the quote is right there on
[page 99](http://www.hikari.org.nz/stuff/random/fortran_barf.jpg).
